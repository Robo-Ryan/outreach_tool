**Facebook Messaging Automation**

This Node.js script automates sending Facebook messages to users using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser automation and [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) to read a list of URLs and messages from an Excel file.

**‚ú® Features**

-  Logs into Facebook using provided credentials

-  Reads Facebook profile URLs and messages from an Excel file

-  Sends messages to users through Messenger

-  Waits a random number of minutes (5--10) between messages to mimic human behavior

2.  Logs in to Facebook
